# PagePulse: Interactive Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

PagePulse is an interactive web-based simulation tool for visualizing and understanding different page replacement algorithms in operating systems. It provides a comprehensive platform for learning about memory management concepts through visual simulations and comparisons.

## Features

### Page Replacement Algorithms
- **FIFO (First In First Out)**: Simulates the basic page replacement strategy
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Demonstrates time-based page replacement
- **Optimal**: Shows the theoretical best-case scenario
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Illustrates frequency-based page replacement
- **Clock (Second Chance)**: Implements the efficient circular queue-based replacement strategy

### Interactive Simulation
- Step-by-step visualization of page replacement process
- Real-time memory frame updates
- Page fault and hit tracking
- Play/pause functionality with adjustable speed
- Previous/Next step navigation
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Interactive timeline visualization

### Comparison Tools
- Side-by-side comparison of all algorithms
- Performance metrics visualization
- Interactive charts showing:
  - Page faults
  - Page hits
  - Efficiency ratios
  - Memory usage patterns

### Educational Features
- Comprehensive theory explanations for each algorithm
- Visual timeline of memory operations
- Detailed statistics and metrics
- Algorithm-specific theory tabs with:
  - Overview
